# MCP Server Integration for Zero-Day Scout

This document explains how the Zero-Day Scout system integrates with the CVE-Search MCP (Model Context Protocol) server to enhance vulnerability research capabilities.

## Overview

The integration connects Zero-Day Scout's agent system to a local CVE-Search MCP server, providing real-time access to comprehensive vulnerability databases. This allows the agent to look up specific CVEs, search for vendor/product vulnerabilities, and retrieve the latest security information directly from authoritative sources.

## Architecture

The integration follows this architecture:

```

                                             ┌────────────────┐

                                             │ Server         │

```

## Components

### 1. MCP Client

The MCP client handles communication with the CVE-Search MCP server. It converts tool requests into appropriate API calls and formats the responses for consumption by the agent system.

#### Key Features:
- Connection management to the local MCP server
- Request/response handling
- Error handling and retries
- Response formatting and normalization

### 2. Enhanced CVE Tools

The existing `CveLookupTool` has been enhanced to use the MCP client, providing the following capabilities:

#### Key Capabilities:
- **CVE lookup**: Fetch detailed information about specific CVE IDs
- **Vendor lookup**: Retrieve vulnerabilities associated with specific vendors
- **Product lookup**: Find vulnerabilities related to specific products/versions
- **Latest CVEs**: Access the most recent security vulnerabilities
- **Keyword search**: Find CVEs matching specific security keywords

## Setup Requirements

To use the MCP integration:

1. Ensure you have the CVE-Search MCP server running locally:
   - Follow the installation instructions at https://github.com/roadwy/cve-search_mcp
   - Start the MCP server using the provided script

2. Configure the connection:
   - The system expects the MCP server to be running at the default location
   - If needed, update the connection settings in the configuration file

## Using MCP Features in Queries

The agent system automatically leverages the MCP server when appropriate. Examples of queries that benefit from MCP integration:

- "What are the latest vulnerabilities in Apache Struts?"
- "Tell me about CVE-2023-12345"
- "What security issues affect Microsoft Exchange Server?"
- "Show me critical vulnerabilities from the last 30 days"

## Benefits of MCP Integration

- **Real-time data**: Access the latest vulnerability information from authoritative sources
- **Comprehensive lookups**: Go beyond RAG-based information with structured database access
- **Authority verification**: Cross-reference RAG findings with official vulnerability databases
- **Enriched analysis**: Provide CVSS scores, affected versions, and attack vectors for better security assessment

## Technical Implementation

The implementation follows these principles:

1. **Graceful degradation**: If the MCP server is unavailable, the system falls back to RAG-based information retrieval
2. **Result enrichment**: CVE data enhances and validates findings from the RAG pipeline
3. **Response formatting**: MCP responses are formatted consistently for better agent understanding
4. **Caching**: Frequent lookup results are cached to improve performance

## Future Enhancements

Potential future improvements to the MCP integration:

1. Expanded coverage to additional vulnerability databases
2. Integration with threat intelligence feeds
3. Custom vulnerability scoring based on organization context
4. Visualization of vulnerability trends and statistics
5. Vendor/product watchlist for continuous monitoring
